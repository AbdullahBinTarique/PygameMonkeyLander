Listing all functions in the Pygame library here would be impractical due to the large number of functions spread across numerous modules. Instead, I can provide a categorized overview of the main modules and some of their key functions:

pygame.display:
set_mode()
get_surface()
set_caption()
flip()
update()
toggle_fullscreen()
get_window_size()
set_gamma()
set_icon()
iconify()
set_allowed()
set_mode_flags()
list_modes()
pygame.draw:
line()
aaline()
lines()
aalines()
polygon()
apolygon()
rect()
circle()
ellipse()
arc()
pieslice()
draw() (Draws shapes onto surfaces)
pygame.event:
get()
peek()
post()
clear()
pump()
wait()
poll()
set_blocked()
set_allowed()
set_grab()
pygame.image:
load()
save()
get_extended()
frombuffer()
fromstring()
tostring()
tostring_rgb()
tostring_rgba()
array3d()
array3d_swapxy()
load_extended()
pygame.mixer:
pre_init()
init()
quit()
get_init()
stop()
pause()
unpause()
fadeout()
set_num_channels()
set_reserved()
find_channel()
get_num_channels()
pause()
unpause()
set_volume()
get_volume()
pause()
unpause()
set_reserved()
Channel()
Sound()
music
pygame.sprite:
Group()
GroupSingle()
RenderUpdates()
OrderedUpdates()
LayeredUpdates()
DirtySprite()
spritecollide()
collide_rect()
collide_circle()
collide_circle_ratio()
spritecollideany()
spritecollideall()
spritecollideany()
pygame.font:
Font()
SysFont()
get_fonts()
match_font()
get_default_font()
pygame.time:
delay()
wait()
Clock()
get_ticks()
set_timer()
get_fps()
tick()
Clock.tick_busy_loop()
These are just some of the functions available in Pygame. There are many more functions and sub-modules within Pygame for various functionalities like handling input, managing resources, working with surfaces, and more. For a comprehensive list and detailed documentation, it's recommended to refer to the official Pygame documentation.


Here's a rough breakdown of the number of functions in some of the main Pygame modules:

pygame.display: Approximately 15 functions.
pygame.draw: Over 20 functions.
pygame.event: Around 15 functions.
pygame.image: More than 15 functions.
pygame.mixer: Approximately 30 functions.
pygame.sprite: Over 15 functions.
pygame.font: Around 5 functions.
pygame.time: Over 10 functions.
These estimates are based on a rough count and may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, Pygame includes several other modules not listed here, each with its own set of functions. Furthermore, there may be additional functions introduced in newer versions of Pygame.

For an exact count, you would need to programmatically traverse the Pygame source code and count the functions, which would be a non-trivial task. If you're interested in exploring the functions available in Pygame, I recommend referring to the official Pygame documentation, where you can find comprehensive documentation for each module and its functions.
